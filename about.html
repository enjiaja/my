    <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
    <p>
  Hey, my name’s Enji, a vocational high school student in 10th grade — also a santri, living and studying in a pesantren in Indonesia.<br>

To be honest, I didn’t get into tech because of school.<br> It actually started from something small — I was messing around with a WhatsApp bot. I didn’t really understand much, but the way it worked fascinated me. <br>It could reply, respond, do all these automated things… and I wanted to know how.

I tried figuring things out on my own, <br>but it got confusing fast. So I decided to take a step back and start with something more beginner-friendly: HTML and CSS. Since then, I’ve been slowly learning how websites are made. Nothing fancy — just simple pages, small layouts, trying different stuff.

Being a santri means my schedule's tight, but I still find bits of time to explore coding. Even if it’s just 20 minutes a day, it helps me move forward. I’m not an expert or anything — far from it — but I’m okay with being in the middle of the process.

Eventually, I’d love to build something useful. Maybe go back to making bots again, but this time knowing what I’m actually doing. Until then, I’ll keep learning. Slowly, steadily
